if some serive wants to access s3 since s3 is regional service and out of VPC.
then it has 2 ways eaither go through NAT Gateway and access the s3, in that way it has
to first go to public internet and then access s3.instead use VPC gateway endpoint

NAT(cost is associated for data processing).

other serviec like lambda,sqs,sns need to be accesed by app server in vpc then use VPC
interface endpoint backed by private ink.

if ur saas provider has exposed it's service over internet which may be in SaaS provider
VPC or SaaS AWS VPC, you can access these service using Private link.

***VPC peering:-
lets say u have 100's of VPC and u want to do pperin as peering is 1-1
then their would be 100 VPC peering connections so it would be a mess, so use Transit Gateway.

connect  all VPC's transit gateway .
u can also use transit ateway to connect with ur on-prem servies with help of VPN.
AWS VPC via transit gateway to on-prem would incur lot of cost.
so use ur vpc to on-prem using IPsec VPN.(u have to atach Virtual gateay to ur VPC and
Client gateway to on-prem) and crete IPsec tunnel between these2  this is site to site VPN connection
but the traffic still goes over internet
so use AWS DIrect connect(layer 1 physical connectvity,upto 100GBPS) between AWS VPC and on-prem.

another scenario,u need to acces app in company network u do VPN connection.
In AWS world if you want to access app in AWS VPC , then u can also create
Client VPN endpoint for that VPC and at ur local install VPN client and ten access the app.

In the above diagram, asssume that you have an socialnetworking site, or a video streaming, app
the video is placed in s3 bucket and users accross the world tries to access the video
using the application, so there would be load on ur ec2 isntance servicg the app
and will need scaling so you would have to incur cost, also cost related to hight data transfer.
also there would be latency. so isntaed of that expose the static content directly via S3
for that vide and use cloudfront for better user experience so that the video would be cached to
users' nearest edge loc.
in route 53 for dns use cloudfront ip.

***********
VPC CIDR
ipv4:- 32 bit in lenght, =2 raise to 32
6:- 128 bit in lenght=2 128,ipv6 are public and unique

10.0.0.0/16 16 is prefix, max prefix in aws u can use is /28


SG:-

you can deny specific ip in SG.
NAcl:- has allow and deny rules.(stateleass)
outbound port:- you can use any or within ephermal port range.

***VPC Private Connectivity Options:-
1)VPC Endpoints and Private Links
2)VPC Peering
3)Transit Gateway
4)Site-2-Site VPN.
5)Client VPN
6)Direct Connect

***Instead of NAT gateay u can create a NAT instance as well which acts as a NAT gateay but not recommended for prod env.
SO ur EC2 NAT instances saves cost, but u need t use NAT AMI and disbale src dest check.

VPC Peering
@![VPC Peering](https://github.com/testoranit/AWS-VPC/assets/124513439/a975d4d9-02fe-4dd1-9964-f2c3b5975ab2)

VP peering done, then u need to updTE THE ROUTE TABLES ACCORDINGLY.

******VPC peering limitations

benefits:-
enables priv commbetween vpc's
no need to have IGW or VPn connection between VPC's
Saves VPN connection cost(0.05$/hr).u only pay for in/out data transfer charges of 0.01/GB

limitations:-
VPC Peerin can be used only for direct connumunication between resources in the VPC's
but VPC peering doesn't helped the peered VPC to communicate to Internet via VPN"S,gateways,endpoints.




****************VPC Endpoints (traffic witihn vpc)

1)Gateway ENdpoint(free):- for s3 and dynamo db.
2)Interface endpoint via private link(has cost):- for other aws services
